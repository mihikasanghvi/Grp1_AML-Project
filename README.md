# Background and Context
Dry Eye Disease (DED) is a prevalent condition a4ecting millions worldwide, often linked to prolonged screen time, poor sleep habits, and underlying health conditions. The increasing reliance on digital devices has exacerbated eye strain, making early detection crucial for preventive care. This project uses machine learning to predict DED using demographic, lifestyle, and digital screen exposure factors. By comparing traditional tree-based models, we aim to identify the most e4ective approach for accurate classification and early intervention, reducing long-term ocular complications.

# Dataset Description
The dataset has been taken from Kaggle, with link as follows:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arifmia/sleep-health-and-digital-screen-exposure-dataset/data
The dataset consists of 20,000 records and 26 features, encompassing demographic, lifestyle, and digital screen exposure variables. Key features include age, gender, blood pressure, heart rate, sleep duration, stress levels, and screen time, along with indicators of eye strain such as redness and irritation. The target variable is the presence or absence of Dry Eye Disease, making it a binary classification problem. The dataset contains no missing values, which ensures a clean and comprehensive foundation for machine learning modeling.

# Proposed Machine Learning Techniques
This project will utilize tree-based classification models to predict Dry Eye Disease, including Decision Tree Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and LightGBM. Decision trees provide interpretability by highlighting key risk factors, while Gradient Boosting enhances accuracy by iteratively refining predictions. LightGBM, optimized for e4iciency, is well-suited for handling large datasets with complex patterns. Model performance will be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the most e4ective approach for early detection and intervention.

# Expected Outcomes
• Identification of key predictors of Dry Eye Disease.

• Performance comparison between tree-based models.

• Recommendations for future research and preventive measures based on model findings.
